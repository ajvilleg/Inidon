# Inidon
Calculate the frequency of each initiation codon found in every gene in a sequence

*Note: Inidon is written in Java and will be loaded as a Java applet.*

*Unfortunately, this tool is ancient and I have lost track of the source code. If there is enough demand, I can rewrite this in a much more popular scripting language.*

### How to Run
To run locally, you will need these 2 files:
